## 🚀 How It Works Now

### When You Approve Work:

1. **Developer Submits Work** → PR link submitted through UI
2. **You Review** → Check the work submission
3. **Click "Approve & Release Payment"** → This triggers:
   - ✅ Validates developer's Stellar wallet exists
   - ✅ Checks your balance (must have enough XLM)
   - ✅ Executes **REAL blockchain transaction**
   - ✅ Transfers XLM from your wallet → developer's wallet
   - ✅ Saves transaction hash to database
   - ✅ Sends GitHub notification with Stellar Explorer link
   - ✅ Updates bounty status to "completed"

### Real Transaction Flow:
```
Your Wallet (9,699 XLM)
        ↓
    [Stellar Network]
        ↓
Developer Wallet (+100 XLM)
        ↓
    Transaction Hash: 1327e13e54bd21a2ac1f80272a63ab3c5d59c52aa7bdc3248f66480dac4e877f
        ↓
    Recorded on Blockchain Forever ✅
```

## 🔐 Important Notes

### Security (Current Setup)
- ⚠️ Currently uses **single wallet** from `.env` file
- ⚠️ All payments come from **your account**
- ⚠️ Secret key stored in plain text (development only)

### For Production:
1. **Multi-user Support:**
   - Each user needs their own Stellar wallet
   - Store encrypted secret keys per user
   - OR use Freighter wallet integration (users sign their own transactions)

2. **Security Improvements:**
   - Encrypt secret keys in database
   - Use environment-specific keys
   - Implement transaction signing service
   - Add multi-signature support

3. **Network Migration:**
   - Currently on **testnet** (free XLM)
   - For production, switch to **mainnet** (real money)
   - Update `.env`: `STELLAR_NETWORK=mainnet`
   - Fund accounts with real XLM

---

## 🛠️ Configuration Files

### `.env` (Updated)
```bash
# Stellar Configuration
STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet  # ← NEW: Specifies testnet

SECRETKEY=SD5LUKKM2XZS2SNG3ANDNQULRPFL2V7UOJRD3RB44QRAM3XTOWAI3YBQ
```

### Payment Service: `backend/src/stellar/payment.js`
- ✅ Connects to Stellar Horizon server
- ✅ Handles account loading and validation
- ✅ Builds and signs transactions
- ✅ Submits to blockchain
- ✅ Returns transaction details

### Work Submission Route: `backend/src/routes/workSubmissions.js`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Payment Fails with "Account not found":
- Developer wallet doesn't exist on network
- Solution: Developer needs to fund their account with friendbot

### "Insufficient balance" error:
- Your wallet doesn't have enough XLM
- Solution: Fund your account using friendbot (testnet)

### "Memo too long" error:
- Already fixed! Memos are now limited to 28 bytes

### Backend not reflecting changes:
- Restart backend: `pkill -f "node.*backend" && cd backend && npm start`
